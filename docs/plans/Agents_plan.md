# Plan — Multi-agent platform: Stage 1 the Weekly Finance Pack, Stage 2 the Operations Desk

- **Status:** APPROVED (2026-10-09) — every decision answered by the owner (§7 "Answers"); owner: "the same plan in
  two stages, prepare everything for the new session". Nothing is implemented yet; work starts at Phase 0 (handoff at
  the end).
- **Goal:** one multi-agent platform (LangChain components, LangGraph orchestration, LLMs through **free APIs**) on the
  data we built — PostgreSQL, MongoDB, the RAG corpus — and external tools, under the existing access control (ADR-006):
  - **Stage 1 — Weekly Finance Pack (the main product):** every week, with no manual work by the finance team, a
    **Power BI dashboard** of NileGate's finance KPIs stays current and a **PowerPoint report (English)** states what
    changed, why, which invoices need attention, and where every number comes from; then follow-up questions.
  - **Stage 2 — Operations Desk:** for the Operations department, **B Route & Cost Advisor** (Suez or Cape for a given
    vessel and voyage: distance, days, transit dues, fuel estimate, risk context) and **C Voyage & Disruption Watch**
    (ETA, delay risk, marine weather, Suez traffic, alerts).
  - One **Supervisor** answers questions across both products (e.g. "why did toll revenue drop this week?" may need
    finance KPIs, Suez transits and voyage data together).
- **Why these products:** recurring reporting is where finance teams lose the most time (vendor case studies: a weekly
  report of 6–8 h cut to < 1 h), invoice errors are a known leak (5–10 % of freight invoices carry an error); schedule
  reliability collapsed in 2025 (on-time arrivals 36 % → 13.9 %, carrier ETA error ≈ 15 h) and carriers decide Suez vs
  Cape per service. Stage 2 reuses Stage 1's foundation (tools, RBAC, checkpointer, Validator, evaluation), so it costs
  much less than Stage 1.
- **Order:** Stage 1 builds the foundation and ships the main product; Stage 2 starts after Stage 1's checkpoint.
- **Builds on:** ADR-003 (money in SDR), ADR-004 (progressive toll bands), ADR-006 (RBAC), ADR-011 (news via web
  search), ADR-012 (Supervisor + Analytics Agent; specialists when they earn it), ADR-013 (invoices: the database is
  the source of truth), ADR-016 (migrations), ADR-018 (star schema → its trigger is now: fact / dimension **views**),
  ADR-020 (only numbers that exist in the source — here: only numbers a tool returned), ADR-028 (real AIS vessels are
  reference data, never linked), ADR-031 (files first, one writer), ADR-032 (synthetic voyage rules), ADR-034
  (read-only role), ADR-037 (data policy → amended, §7), ADR-038 / ADR-040 (retrieval tool and its baseline),
  ADR-042 – ADR-044 and `docs/RETRIEVAL_FLOW.md` §2.1 (uploads are untrusted data).

## 1. Starting point (verified 2026-10-09)

| Input | State |
|---|---|
| `invoices` (PostgreSQL) | 1,000 rows, 2025-01-01 → 2025-12-30, **52 ISO weeks**, 11–29 invoices a week (median 19), 268,988,787 SDR in total; status Issued 361 / Pending 328 / Paid 311 (an end-of-2025 snapshot); every amount equals the progressive toll (ADR-004, 0 mismatches) |
| Missing for finance KPIs | no customer (who pays), no due date / payment terms, no payment date, no budget → no AR aging, DSO, collections, top customers, variance |
| `vessels` (500, SCNT tons, type, origin / destination LOCODE), `toll_rate_bands`, `ports` (837), `port_connections` | complete (ARCHITECTURE §4) |
| MongoDB | AIS 1.32 M positions (real samples + synthetic tracks of our 500 vessels up to 2026-09-13), `voyages_synthetic.parquet` (port sequence, legs on sea paths, ADR-032), EDI IFTMIN with `RFF+IV` (376 messages) |
| RAG | `search_documents` (RBAC, exact dense + rerank; baseline balanced 0.850); Suez Notes (tariff rules), USCG / IMO (incidents), HbR annual report |
| Access | `invoices` = level 2 / Finance; vessels, ports, AIS, EDI = level 1 / Operations; HbR financial results = level 3 (CEO only) (`docs/rbac_mapping.md`) |
| Keys in `.env` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (Google AI Studio), `JINA_API_KEY`, `VOYAGE_API_KEY`; **no** Groq / OpenRouter / LangSmith / web-search / aisstream key yet |
| Packages | `searoute`, `httpx`, `psycopg`, `pymongo`, `qdrant-client` installed; no LangChain / LangGraph / python-pptx / matplotlib / psycopg-pool yet |
| Power BI | not installed |

# STAGE 1 — Weekly Finance Pack

## 2. What the finance team receives

**Dashboard (Power BI Desktop, PBIP project in git, DirectQuery on the `finance` views)** — pages: Overview (week KPIs
vs last week / vs budget), Revenue (by vessel category, laden / ballast, band, route), Receivables (AR aging buckets,
DSO, collections, overdue list), Customers (top 10, concentration), Exceptions (invoice audit findings).

**PowerPoint (English, generated, ~10 slides)** — 1 title + week; 2 executive summary (5 bullets, every number cited);
3 KPI tiles; 4 revenue trend (13 weeks) and the week's drivers; 5 revenue mix; 6 receivables and DSO; 7 top customers
and changes; 8 exceptions (audit findings, amounts at stake, proposed action); 9 context (Suez transits, relevant news,
the tariff rule that explains a change); 10 appendix: sources (view + filter for every number), data freshness, what
was not checked. Amounts in SDR (ADR-003).

**Q&A** — follow-up questions in natural language, answered with the same governed tools and the same RBAC.

## 3. Architecture (both stages)

```text
Windows Task Scheduler (weekly)  or  a user's question
 └─► LangGraph StateGraph "weekly_pack" (PostgresSaver checkpoints; report_week = the as-of week)
      1 Data Readiness agent  — week complete? row counts, nulls, duplicates, late invoices → gate (stop + explain)
      2 KPI agent             — calls the governed KPI tool only (SQL views, fixed definitions); no free SQL here
      3 A Invoice Auditor     — recomputes each invoice with the toll bands (compute_toll) → exceptions + evidence
      4 Insight agent         — explains WoW / vs budget changes by drill-down (category, laden/ballast, customer,
                                route) + external context (IMF PortWatch Suez transits, web news) + the tariff rules
                                (search_documents on the Suez Notes)
      5 Report Writer         — narrative + charts → PPTX (python-pptx; charts from the same views)
      6 Validator             — every number in the deck = a tool result (exact match after the stated rounding);
                                every claim has a source; fail → back to 5 with the diff (max 2 loops), then stop
      7 ⏸ interrupt: Finance manager approves / edits / rejects (human in the loop)
      8 Publisher             — saves the approved deck to `reports/<week>/` (save only, no email)
 Stage 2: "route_advice" (B) on request; "voyage_watch" (C) on a schedule (every N hours) and on request
 Supervisor (subagents-as-tools: KPI, Insight, Auditor, Knowledge; Stage 2 adds Route Advisor, Voyage Watch)
   → answers with citations; every node receives the user's RBAC context; tools enforce it in their queries.
```

Why a **workflow with agent steps** for the pack and not a free supervisor: the pack has a fixed shape, its numbers
must be reproducible, and each step can be tested on its own. The supervisor is used for questions.

**Tools (LangChain tools, each with RBAC, a Pydantic schema, tests, a cache and a timeout for external calls):**

| Tool | Source | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| `kpi(report_week, metric, breakdown)` | `finance` views | 1 |
| `invoice_audit(invoice_ids \| week)` | invoices + toll bands | 1 |
| `compute_toll(vessel_id \| category, condition, tons)` | `toll_rate_bands` (ADR-004) | 1 (also B) |
| `search_documents` | existing (ADR-038) | 1 |
| `suez_transits(from, to)` | IMF PortWatch | 1 (also B, C) |
| `web_search(query)` | news (ADR-011; provider chosen at Phase 4) | 1 (also B, C) |
| `sea_route(origin, destination, avoid)` | `searoute` (installed), e.g. avoiding Suez for the Cape route | 2 |
| `voyage_status(vessel_id \| mmsi)` / `query_operations` | MongoDB AIS + synthetic voyages | 2 |
| `vessel_live(bbox \| mmsi)` | aisstream.io (live, real vessels: reference only, ADR-028) | 2 |
| `marine_weather(lat, lon, time)` | Open-Meteo Marine (waves, wind; free, non-commercial, attribution) | 2 |

**Structured outputs (owner question, 2026-10-09):** every structured result (KPI rows, audit findings, the deck
outline, route comparisons, ETA estimates, Validator verdicts) is a **Pydantic model** — one class serves the LLM
(`with_structured_output`), the tools, the Validator and the tests; validators mirror the database CHECKs (invoice
number format, amounts ≥ 0, LOCODE format); the JSON schema is generated from it (`model_json_schema()`). Models stay
simple (shallow nesting, `Literal` instead of complex enums, no unions) because free providers support different
JSON-schema subsets; the method (`function_calling` / `json_schema` / `json_mode`) is chosen per model by the bake-off;
on failure: validate → one retry with the error → stop.

**Skills (owner, 2026-10-10):** the agents' procedures and company knowledge are **Agent Skills** — one folder per
skill with a `SKILL.md` (the open standard LangChain Deep Agents also uses: a one-line frontmatter description always
visible, the full instructions loaded only when needed, optional reference files). They live in git under
`pipelines/agents/skills/<name>/`, written by us (company knowledge exists nowhere else) and reviewable by the owner
without touching code. A small loader in the library (no new dependency): a workflow node loads its fixed skill
directly (no discovery call); the Q&A supervisor gets a `load_skill(name)` tool and sees only the descriptions.
Why it matters here: free tiers have small per-minute token limits (Groq 8K TPM), so prompts carry only the skill a
step needs. First skills: `finance-kpi-definitions`, `suez-toll-audit`, `weekly-variance-analysis`, `deck-style-guide`,
`number-validation`, `untrusted-content` (Stage 1); `route-cost-advice`, `voyage-eta-method` (Stage 2). Skills hold
instructions and references only; any script a skill points to is project code, reviewed like any other.
**Not used:** vendor-licensed docx / pptx / xlsx / pdf skills (proprietary licence: no copies or derivatives); skills from
open registries (2026 audits: ~13 % with a critical issue — credential theft, prompt injection inside SKILL.md).
**Development skills (for the coding assistant, not the agents):** `langchain-ai/langchain-skills` (official) installed in
the local skills folder at Phase 0 after review — licence checked, a pinned commit, every file read before install, only the
LangGraph / LangChain-core skills needed.

## 4. Data additions (Stage 1; synthetic, files first, one writer — ADR-031 pattern)

A generator script (fixed seed) writes CSVs + a manifest; a migration loads them; `verify_readonly.sql` gets a new
section; nothing existing is regenerated (ADR-013: invoices stay as they are).
- `customers` (~40 shipping lines / agents; name, country, segment, payment terms 30 / 45 / 60 days, payment behaviour
  class) and `vessels.customer_id` (each vessel billed to one customer; FK).
- invoice terms: `due_date` = invoice_date + the customer's terms (column or view).
- `payments` (invoice_number, paid_date, amount; no partial payments), **consistent with the end-of-2025 status**:
  Paid → fully paid on or before 2025-12-31; Issued / Pending → unpaid at 2025-12-31.
- `budget_weekly` (week, vessel_category, budget_sdr), derived by a documented rule (a seasonal plan ± a stated
  target), not fitted to the actuals. No second year (no YoY) for now.
- **As-of logic:** an invoice's status in week *w* is derived from the dates (issued, due, paid), not from the snapshot
  column, so each of the 52 weeks can be reported as it looked then.
- **Injected test cases (evaluation only):** a separate, labelled copy of a few weeks with known invoice errors and a
  budget miss, so the Auditor and the Insight agent are measured against ground truth. Never mixed into the real tables.
- The concrete rules (counts, shares, the budget rule) are shown to the owner before any generation (D6, as ADR-032).

## 5. Phases

| Phase | Work | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1** | | |
| 0 | branch `feat/agents`; `uv add` langchain(-core), langgraph, the provider packages (Google GenAI, Groq, an OpenAI-compatible client for OpenRouter), `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`, `psycopg-pool`, `pydantic`, `python-pptx`, `matplotlib`, `langsmith`; provider smoke test (each key, one call, tool calling on); `common.SECRET_KEYS` + `.env.example`; reviewed install of the official `langchain-skills` (LangGraph / core) into the local skills folder; **LLM bake-off on free APIs (§7a)**, Gemini first | every package pinned with `==` in `pyproject.toml`; bake-off results file; the model choice as an ADR; the ADR-037 amendment written |
| 1 | Finance data generator + migration(s) + audit (§4) | invariants pass (status ↔ payments, terms, FK, totals), reload = no change |
| 2 | `finance` schema: star views (`fact_invoice`, `fact_payment`, `dim_date` (ISO week), `dim_customer`, `dim_vessel`, `dim_toll_band`) + KPI views / functions per `report_week`; `docs/finance_metrics.md` (one definition per metric) | every KPI equals a hand-computed value on 3 chosen weeks; RBAC: a non-Finance employee gets nothing |
| 3 | Power BI Desktop (owner, guided): install, PBIP project `powerbi/`, DirectQuery to the views with a read-only login, the 5 pages; measures through the official Power BI Modeling MCP | the dashboard's numbers for 3 weeks = the KPI views |
| 4 | Stage 1 tools (§3) + tests; external tools behind a cache and a timeout ("context unavailable", never a guess); the skill loader + the Stage 1 skills (`pipelines/agents/skills/`) | each tool tested on its own; RBAC matrix 0 leakage; every skill parses (frontmatter, size budget) and is reviewed by the owner |
| 5 | LangGraph workflow + agents + PostgresSaver (`agent_state` schema, writer role: migration) + interrupt | a pack for any week runs end to end; resume after a crash works |
| 6 | PPTX template (NileGate style) + Writer + Validator | the Validator catches every planted wrong number in a test deck |
| 7 | Evaluation (§8) on golden weeks + finance Q&A golden questions | the D7 thresholds are met (or the owner decides) |
| 8 | Scheduling (Task Scheduler), LangSmith tracing, checkpoint retention | a scheduled run produces the pack and waits for approval |
| S1 ✔ | **Stage 1 checkpoint:** ADRs, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, a PR; the plan stays active | — |
| **Stage 2** | | |
| 9 | Stage 2 tools: `sea_route` (Suez vs Cape distances; `searoute` restriction support checked here), `voyage_status`, `vessel_live` (aisstream.io), `marine_weather`; fuel / speed parameter table (S2-D3) | each tool tested; live tools degrade gracefully |
| 10 | **B Route & Cost Advisor** graph (`route_advice`): inputs vessel + origin / destination; outputs a Pydantic comparison (distance, sea days at the vessel's speed, Suez dues via `compute_toll`, fuel estimate from the parameter table, risk context: PortWatch trend + news) and a recommendation with its assumptions; the Validator checks every number | the S2 route cases (§8) pass |
| 11 | **C Voyage & Disruption Watch** graph (`voyage_watch`): ETA (baseline: remaining sea distance / recent speed), delay risk (weather on the next legs, Suez traffic), alerts saved to a table / file (save only) and shown on request; scheduled every N hours (S2-D1) | ETA error on replayed synthetic voyages beats the naive baseline (§8); alerts reproducible |
| 12 | Supervisor extended to both products; cross-product questions; RBAC matrix (Operations ↔ Finance) | S2 Q&A golden questions pass; RBAC leakage 0 |
| 13 | Close: ADRs, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, archive the plan | — |

## 6. Stage 2 — Operations Desk (details)

- **Users:** Operations employees / managers and the CEO (level-1 operational data). Finance data stays invisible to
  them (level 2 / Finance), and the agents enforce that in their tools.
- **B Route & Cost Advisor.** "Should vessel X (Laden, 85,000 SCNT) sail Port Said → Rotterdam via Suez or the Cape?" →
  two routes from `sea_route`, sea days from the vessel's service speed, Suez transit dues from the progressive bands
  (SDR), fuel = days × consumption per day (by vessel type, a documented parameter table) × a bunker price **set by the
  owner and dated** (no free live bunker-price source), risk context from PortWatch and news. The answer always lists
  its assumptions; no number without a tool behind it.
- **C Voyage & Disruption Watch.** For our 500 synthetic vessels (voyages up to the as-of instant 2026-09-13, ADR-032):
  current position and next port, ETA, the weather on the next legs (Open-Meteo forecast at route points), Suez traffic,
  a delay-risk flag with reasons → alerts. Live AIS (aisstream.io) shows real traffic in a bounding box (e.g. Suez /
  Red Sea) as situational awareness only: real vessels are never linked to ours (ADR-028).
- **Evaluation ground truth:** the synthetic tracks know every real arrival time → cut a voyage at time *t*, predict,
  compare (MAE in hours) against the naive baseline; route cases hand-computed from the same formulas.

## 7. Decisions — Stage 1 (answered) and Stage 2 (to answer before Phase 9)

### Answers (owner, 2026-10-09)

| Decision | Answer |
|---|---|
| D1 LLM | **free APIs only**: Google AI Studio (key exists), Groq, OpenRouter → bake-off §7a; two models per role (main + fallback) |
| D2 Orchestration | StateGraph workflow for the pack (and Stage 2 graphs) + a supervisor with subagents-as-tools for Q&A (`langgraph-supervisor` is no longer maintained) |
| D3 Checkpointer | PostgresSaver, schema `agent_state`, a writer role (migration; `ports_readonly` cannot write), `setup()` as a deployment step, retention job |
| D4 Star schema | plain views in schema `finance` (ADR-018's preferred shape) |
| D5 Power BI | Desktop (free, no sign-in) + PBIP / TMDL in git + DirectQuery (current when opened, no refresh, no gateway) + the official Modeling MCP (model only; pages built once with the owner); PPTX from Python (export needs Fabric capacity). Upgrade path: a work / school account → Service as an adapter |
| D6 Synthetic finance | approved as proposed; concrete rules shown before generation |
| D7 Evaluation | strict: deck numbers 100 % (hard gate), planted errors found ≥ 95 %, false alarms ≤ 5 %, every claim traceable, RBAC leakage 0 |
| D8 Observability | LangSmith (free developer plan) |
| D9 Distribution | save only (`reports/<week>/`); no email |
| D10 Infrastructure | `psycopg_pool` now; Redis and DirectML stay deferred |
| D11 External tools | web search (news), IMF PortWatch, live AIS (aisstream.io), marine weather (Open-Meteo); no SDR-rate tool |
| D12 Clock | replay of 2025's 52 weeks (`report_week`) |
| Data policy | **ADR-037 amendment:** synthetic and public data may go to free tiers, minimized (aggregates instead of rows where possible, no employee names); real company data → paid tiers only |
| Plan shape | one plan, two stages (Stage 2 = B + C) |
| D13 Runtime skills (2026-10-10) | Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` standard) written by us in `pipelines/agents/skills/` + our own small loader (workflow nodes load their fixed skill; the supervisor gets `load_skill`); no Deep Agents dependency for now |
| D14 Development skills (2026-10-10) | install the official `langchain-ai/langchain-skills` (LangGraph / core) in the local skills folder at Phase 0, after a review (licence, pinned commit, every file read) |

### Stage 2 decisions (recommended option first; answer before Phase 9)

- **S2-D1 — Alerts:** a scheduled `voyage_watch` run every N hours (Task Scheduler) writing alerts to a table / file,
  read on request (save only, like D9). *Alt:* a long-running monitor process; push notifications.
- **S2-D2 — ETA method:** rule-based baseline first (distance / recent speed + port-call allowance); a learned model
  only if it beats the baseline by a margin fixed beforehand. *Alt:* ML from the start.
- **S2-D3 — Fuel and speed parameters:** a documented table per vessel type (service speed, consumption / day) + a
  bunker price set by the owner with its date. *Alt:* a paid bunker-price feed.
- **S2-D4 — Live AIS scope:** one bounding box (Suez Canal + Red Sea), a short sampling window per run, no storage
  beyond a run's snapshot. *Alt:* store a rolling window in MongoDB (a new collection through the one writer).
- **S2-D5 — Thresholds** (fixed before the Stage 2 runs): route numbers 100 % from tools; ETA MAE better than the naive
  baseline; alert precision measured on planted weather / traffic events.

### 7a. LLM bake-off on free APIs (rules fixed before any run)

- **Candidates (verified 2026-10-09):** AI Studio — `gemini-3.8-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemma-4-31b-it`
  (Pro models left the free tier on 2026-04-01; free limits are shown in AI Studio only; **the free tier may use inputs
  to improve Google's products**); Groq — `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (free: 30 RPM,
  1,000 RPD, 8K TPM, 200K TPD per model, per organization; states no training on API data); OpenRouter `:free` —
  `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, `thinkingmachines/inkling`, `poolside/laguna-s-2.1` (20 RPM, **50 requests /
  day** across free models, 1,000 / day after a one-time $10; providers' data policies differ → privacy
  settings: "may train" allowed for synthetic data, "publish prompts" off). Free catalogues change: the script reads the live model list and skips a vanished model, reported.
- **Tasks (existing data only, no new tables):** T1 tool calling (20 questions; right tool, right arguments, right final
  number; tools: `compute_toll`, a weekly KPI over the existing invoices, `search_documents`); T2 grounded weekly summary
  (10 weeks of KPI tables → 5 bullets; every number in the text must appear in the table = hard gate; driver coverage);
  T3 structured output (an exceptions list as a Pydantic model; validity per method); T4 RAG answers on the frozen
  golden set (fact recall against `golden_facts.jsonl`, citation validity).
- **Also measured:** latency, requests and tokens per simulated pack (does a week fit the free quota?), 429 / error rate.
- **Rule:** a model with any number not in its input on T2 is out for Writer / Insight; among the rest, the best mean of
  T1, T3, T4 per role (Writer / Insight vs routing / tools), ties broken by quota fit; main + fallback per role.
- **Files first:** every response cached by (model, task item, prompt hash), so a run resumes across days without
  repeating calls; results in `Data/processed/agents/eval/llm_bakeoff_<date>.json`.

## 8. Evaluation

- **Stage 1 golden weeks:** ~10 of the 52 weeks chosen before any run (quiet weeks, peak weeks, a week with planted
  invoice errors, a budget miss, a week where Suez transits moved), with expected KPIs computed by SQL and expected
  findings written by hand.
- **Stage 1 golden questions:** ~30 finance questions (EN) with expected numbers / sources; RBAC cases (an Operations
  employee asking for receivables, a manager asking for level-3 HbR results).
- **Stage 2:** ~12 route cases (hand-computed); ETA on ~50 replayed synthetic voyages (MAE vs the naive baseline);
  planted weather / traffic events for alerts; ~20 operations questions + cross-product questions; RBAC both ways.
- **Measured:** number correctness, finding recall / false alarms, traceability, RBAC, latency, requests / tokens per
  run (free quotas), Validator loops. One results file per run = the baseline for the next change.

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| The LLM writes a wrong number | numbers only from tools; Validator exact match; human approval before saving the pack |
| Free quotas run out mid-pack | main + fallback model per role; cache; quota use measured per pack; checkpoints resume later |
| A free model disappears or changes | live model list checked each run; the bake-off re-run picks a replacement |
| Synthetic data looks unreal | rules approved first; distributions documented; labelled synthetic everywhere |
| DirectQuery limits some DAX | KPIs computed in SQL views; DAX measures stay simple; Import mode as a fallback |
| Power BI Service needs a work account | the design does not depend on it; the Service is an adapter |
| External APIs down / changed | cache + timeout; "context unavailable" instead of guessing |
| Data on free tiers (training) | ADR-037 amendment: synthetic / public only, minimized; real data → paid tiers |
| Agent changes the Power BI model badly | PBIP in git, review the diff, MCP on a branch |
| Fuel / ETA numbers read as facts | assumptions printed with every answer; parameters dated and owner-set |

## Progress / deviations

- 2026-10-09 — plan written (PROPOSED), all decisions answered the same day (§7 "Answers"); structured outputs =
  Pydantic models; owner: one plan in two stages (Stage 2 = B Route & Cost Advisor + C Voyage & Disruption Watch) →
  APPROVED. File renamed from `Agents_Finance_Weekly_Pack_plan.md`.
- 2026-10-10 — owner: Agent Skills for the agents, written by us with our own loader (D13); the official
  `langchain-skills` for the coding assistant after review (D14); OpenRouter "may train" allowed for synthetic data.

### SESSION HANDOFF (2026-10-09) — read this first in the next session

- **Git (owner, before any code):** (1) commit the RAG Phase 9 close and this plan on `feat/rag-retrieval`, push, open
  the PR to `master`, merge; (2) `git switch master`, `git pull`, `git switch -c feat/agents`. The assistant never runs git
  (guard hook).
- **Owner actions:** add `GROQ_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `.env` (OpenRouter Privacy settings: free
  endpoints that may train stay **allowed** — synthetic data only, per the ADR-037 amendment, and turning them off
  shrinks the free candidates; "publish prompts" stays **off**); later `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` (LangSmith, Phase 8), the web-search key (Phase 4), the
  aisstream.io key (Phase 9). Delete `models\_rejected_delete_me\`, `models\hf\` and the contents of
  `Notebooks\_scratch\` (deletions are denied for the assistant).
- **State:** RAG plan closed and archived (`docs/archive/2026-10-08_RAG_Embeddings_Qdrant_plan.md`); migration 011
  applied; Docker: `ports-postgres`, `ports-qdrant` (start them if exited); `ports-mongo` exited (start it for Stage 2).
- **Found 2026-10-10 (do in Phase 0):** `pipelines/lib/common.SECRET_KEYS` lacks `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  (and later `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, the web-search and aisstream keys) → add them so `redact()` hides them; `.env.example`
  does not exist although the project rules lists it → create it with variable names only (no values).
- **Skills (D13 / D14, 2026-10-10):** Phase 0 also installs the reviewed `langchain-skills` for the coding assistant; the
  agents' own skills come in Phase 4 (§3 "Skills").
- **Next (assistant): Phase 0** — `uv add` the packages (report the `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock` changes); a smoke-test
  script `pipelines/scripts/agents/LLM_smoke_test.py` (each key present → one call with tool calling); then the bake-off
  script `pipelines/scripts/agents/LLM_bakeoff.py` (§7a: write T1–T4 and their expected answers **before** any model
  call, freeze their hash, cache every response, Gemini first; Groq / OpenRouter once their keys exist); results →
  an ADR (model per role) + the ADR-037 amendment. Use the skill `script-dev-loop` for the scripts.
- **Owner preferences:** free tiers / free tools first; the assistant implements everything and reports (no TODO(human));
  replies in Arabic, code and docs in English.
